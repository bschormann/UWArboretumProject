/**
 * The HelloWorld app is the most basic Map app for the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android. It shows how to define a MapView
 * in the layout XML of the activity. Within the XML definition of the MapView, MapOptions attributes are used to
 * populate that MapView with a basemap layer showing streets, and also the initial extent and zoom level are set. By
 * default, this map supports basic zooming and panning operations. This sample also demonstrates calling the MapView
 * pause and unpause methods from the Activity onPause and onResume methods, which suspend and resume map rendering
 * threads. A reference to the MapView is set within the onCreate method of the Activity which can be used at the
 * starting point for further coding.
